# In python, we use comments by adding this # hy sign before anything
# We can use comments to communicate with developers reading our code
# We can tell that why we have written this code in a certain way

# We can also have comments over multiple lines. Each line should start with a new hy # sugn
# jkdncks
# vfkj

# Comments are not executed by the prgrm

# Bad comments?
# print Sky is blue
print("Sky is blue")
# Its a bad comment because its telling me the obvious

# Use comments to explain why's not what is already obvious
# We can use comments for assumptions or for remind notes
