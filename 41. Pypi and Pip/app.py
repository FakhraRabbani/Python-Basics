# In this directory, u can find thousands of packages for doing awesome things.
# Lets say u want to send text msgs from ur prgrms, u dont have to build this functionality in ur prgrm
# We can simply come to pypi.org and search for sms and as u can see there are so many projects or packages that giv u this functionality
# Of course not every package or every project is complete or bug free, some of them are still in development or they have bugs.
