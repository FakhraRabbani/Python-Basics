#Receiving Input from user
#Prgrm -> Asking user name and printing it

#input, print -> Built-in functions in Python
#() -> These parenthesis means we are calling or executing that function. Its like pressing a button on remote control

#In input function, we will pass a string which will be printed on terminal
#Then we will wait for user to enter value. When user enters value, the input function returns
#So we get that value and store it in memory using a variable
#We put the result in a variable like name

name = input('What is your name? ')

#Now we want to dynamically print what we have in name variable
#We concatenate string Hi with another string which is in name variable

print('Hi ' +  name)

#This was another example of expression
#This expression concatenates or combines 2 strings
