# Comparison Operator -> Use where we want to compare a variable with a value

# For eg,
# if temperature is greater than 30 -> its a hot day
# otherwise if its less than 10 -> its a cold day
# otherwise its neither hot nor cold

# temperature = 30
temperature = 35

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day")
else:
    print("It's not a hot day")

# Comparison Operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
