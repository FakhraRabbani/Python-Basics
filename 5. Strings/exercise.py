# When we print name[1:-1], what we are gonna see on terminal?
# Guess?

# This expression will return characters starting from index 1 which is second character all the way to first character from the end but excluding the character at index -1
# First character from end is r, so r will be excluded
# We are only going to see character from e to second e

name = 'Jennifer'
print(name[1:-1]) #ennife
