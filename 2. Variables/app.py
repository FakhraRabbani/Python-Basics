#Variables -> Store data temporarily in computer's memory

#Defining Variable
price = 10
#When python interpreter will execute this code, it will allocate some memory and store the number 10 in that memory
#And then it will attach price label in memory location

#Printing price on terminal
print(price)

#The number 10 will first be converted to binary.
#The no 10 we have is in decimal system which has all digits from 0 to 9
#Computers only understand 0 and ones
#So when storing 10 in computer memory, first it will get converted to binary, then it will get stored in computers memory

#Updating value of price variable
price = 20
print(price)

#Python interpreter executes the code line by line

#The nos we had here are whole nos without a decimal point
#These numbers are called integers
#Integer -> A number without a decimal point

#Floating Point number / Float
price = 4.9
print(price)

#Strings
name = 'Fakhra'

#Booleans -> True, False
is_published = True

#Python -> Case sensitive language
#Defining variables -> Use lower case letters
#True, False -> Special keywords, so python doesnt understand false but it understands False

#Simple Values -> Integers, floats, strings, boolean

#We can also store complex values like lists and values
